Strt ups are meant to be temporary.
Successful start ups find a profitable and sustainable business model that has a good product/maret fit and scales
--> Your startup's top unknown is the customer

Get out and talk to people to see if they would want your product!

Fake it till you make it!
- you don't hae to have a finished product to show people
- mock up/minimal prototype is all you need to present to prospective customers

Pivot fast and fail fast!
- If something doesn't work, find out what does and modify your idea to accommodate.
- cut chord asap if gonna fail

Learn the Lean Startup methodology
